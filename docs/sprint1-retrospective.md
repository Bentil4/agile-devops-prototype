# Sprint 1 Retrospective

## Sprint Overview

- **Duration:** 05/02/2026 - 08/02/2026
- **Stories Completed:** 4 out of 4
- **Story Points Completed:** 8 out of 8

---

## What Went Well

### 1. Test-Driven Development

- **Observation:** Writing tests alongside development caught bugs early
- **Impact:** Higher code quality, fewer bugs in production
- **Action:** Continue TDD approach in Sprint 2

### 2. Pair Programming on Complex Features

- **Observation:** Pairing on CRUD operations led to better design
- **Impact:** Knowledge sharing, fewer code review iterations
- **Action:** Continue pairing on complex features


### 3. Clear Requirements

- **Observation:** User stories were well-defined with clear acceptance criteria
- **Impact:** Less back-and-forth, faster development
- **Action:** Maintain quality of user story writing

---

## What Didn't Go Well

### 1. Late Test Writing

- **Observation:** Some tests not written after code implementation
- **Impact:** Missed opportunity for TDD benefits
- **Action:** Write tests after implementation
- **Improvement:** Write tests first or simultaneously

---

## Specific Improvements for Sprint 2 

#### 1. Automated Code Quality Checks

- **Observation:** Manual linting and formatting checks are time-consuming
- **Impact:** Inconsistent code style, wasted review time
- **Action:** Start using automated linters and formatters
- **Implementation:** Setup ESLint pre-commit hooks in Sprint 2

## Process Observations

### Time Management

- **Estimated vs Actual:** [How accurate were story point estimates?]
- **Bottlenecks:** [Where did work slow down?]
- **Efficiency:** [What could speed up development?]

### Technical Practices

- **Testing:** [How effective was the testing approach?]
- **CI/CD:** [How well did the pipeline work?]
- **Code Quality:** [Was code quality maintained?]

### Documentation

- **Completeness:** [Was documentation kept up to date?]
- **Clarity:** [Was documentation clear and useful?]
- **Timeliness:** [Was documentation done alongside code?]

## Action Items for Sprint 2

| Action                        | Owner | Priority | Status |
| ----------------------------- | ----- | -------- | ------ |
| Setup ESLint pre-commit hooks | Team  | High     | Todo   |
| Implement CI/CD pipeline      | Team  | High     | Todo   |

## Metrics to Track in Sprint 2

To measure improvement, I will track:
- [ ] Number of commits per day
- [ ] Average commit size (lines changed)
- [ ] Test coverage percentage
- [ ] Pipeline success rate
- [ ] Time spent on documentation
- [ ] [Other metric]
